# Tasty-Racing-Prototype
 
Tasty Racing is a 3D third - person racing game created using the Unity Engine. The title tasty comes from the theme of the game which is foods. Currently I am working on adding some updates regarding player win/loss and obstacles on the track. 

Some things that I am researching about implementing are multiplayer, better UI, and sound.
